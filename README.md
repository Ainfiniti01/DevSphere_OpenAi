##  🚀 OpenAI Build Week Scope

DevSphere is an existing developer collaboration platform.

During OpenAI Build Week, the focus was on extending the platform using GPT-5.6 and Codex rather than building a new application from scratch.

The new work includes Project Templates, Team Roles, Saved Projects, and Pinned Chat Messages, alongside architecture improvements, bug fixes, and UI refinements.

## 🚀 OpenAI Build Week Contributions

Although DevSphere existed before this event, the following functionality was designed and implemented during the OpenAI Build Week using GPT-5.6 and Codex:

- 📁 Project Templates for improved project organization and filtering
- 👑 Explicit Team Roles (Founder & Contributor)
- ⭐ Saved Projects
- 📌 Pinned Chat Messages for project conversations
- 🎨 UI polish and workflow improvements
- 🐞 Bug fixes and performance improvements

These additions were integrated into the existing architecture, tested locally, and deployed during OpenAI Build Week.

## AI-assisted Development

Throughout OpenAI Build Week, GPT-5.6 and Codex were used as engineering assistants for:

- feature planning
- implementation strategy
- React component refactoring
- SQL migration generation
- Supabase debugging
- architecture reviews
- UI refinement
- bug fixing
- code explanations
- implementation verification

All generated code was reviewed, adapted, tested, and integrated manually before deployment.

Codex accelerated development by:

- generating implementation plans

- refactoring React components

- writing and improving SQL migrations

- helping debug frontend and backend issues

- suggesting architecture improvements

- speeding up feature implementation while preserving developer control


All final engineering decisions, testing, integration, and verification were completed by the project author.


## 🛠 Development Workflow

The project was developed iteratively.

Typical workflow:


1. Define the feature.

2. Use GPT-5.6/Codex to explore implementation approaches.

3. Review and adapt generated code.

4. Integrate with the existing architecture.

5. Test locally.

6. Fix issues.

7. Deploy and verify.




## 🌍 The Problem

Modern software development is highly fragmented. Developers constantly switch between disconnected platforms—GitHub for code, Discord/Slack for chat, Notion/Trello for task tracking, and LinkedIn for recruiting. This fragmentation causes critical friction: finding reliable collaborators is difficult, promising startup ideas are abandoned when teams lose momentum, project knowledge is scattered, and onboarding new contributors is highly inefficient. Without structured guidance, teams suffer from scope creep and poor technical decisions. 

DevSphere solves these challenges by unifying project discovery, team formation, real-time communication, task management, and context-aware AI assistance into a single, integrated platform.

> *"DevSphere enables developers to discover projects, build teams, collaborate in real time, and receive context-aware AI guidance—all from a single platform."*

```

1. **Project Setup:** Users create or join projects, establishing their roles and permissions.
2. **Contextual Reasoning:** Supabase Edge Functions (Qwen-Plus) analyze the project metadata, factoring in the user's role and permissions.
3. **State Synthesis:** The AI updates the project's roadmap, task lists, and sprint plans, providing fresh insights and recommended actions on the dashboard.

---

## 🛠️ Engineering Challenges Solved

* **State Synchronization across AI Conversations:** Solved by designing a server-side context assembly layer in Supabase Edge Functions that queries the database in real-time before invoking the AI. This ensures the AI always has access to the latest project metadata, team memberships, and user roles without overloading the context window.
* **Role-Aware AI Reasoning:** Designed a system prompt that dynamically adapts the AI's persona, permissions, and output style based on the user's relationship to the project. This prevents visitors from seeing private planning details while giving owners advanced sprint planning tools.
* **Grounding AI Responses to Prevent Hallucination:** Implemented strict grounding rules in the system prompt, instructing the AI to explicitly state when information is unavailable rather than inventing it. This restricts the AI from fabricating project details, team members, or deadlines.
* **Real-Time Event Synchronization:** Kept chat messages, read receipts, join requests, and notifications synchronized across multiple clients instantly. This was achieved by leveraging Supabase Realtime PostgreSQL replication and custom database triggers.
* **Secure AI Integration:** Protected sensitive project information, database credentials, and the Alibaba Cloud API key. All AI reasoning is performed server-side within protected Supabase Edge Functions, ensuring the client never has direct access to the API keys or raw database secrets.

## 🧠 Context-Aware AI Project Manager Implementation

DevSphere satisfies the AI Application requirements through four core capabilities:

* **Project Awareness:** The AI understands the project title, description, problem statement, proposed solution, development stage, required skills, team members, and founder information.
* **Role-Based Intelligence:** Responses adapt depending on who is interacting (Visitors, Applicants, Team Members, or Project Owners).
* **Contextual Reasoning:** The AI remains focused on the current project instead of acting as a general-purpose assistant, avoiding inventing missing project details.
* **Secure Design:** Sensitive information such as authentication tokens, API keys, and private backend details are never exposed through AI responses.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Database/Auth:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + RLS)
- **AI Engine:** Alibaba Cloud Qwen-Plus (DashScope Workspace Endpoint)
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Backend:** Supabase Edge Functions

---

## ☁️ Alibaba Cloud Integration

DevSphere leverages Alibaba Cloud's state-of-the-art **Qwen-Plus** model to power its Context-Aware AI Project Manager. 

### Why Alibaba Cloud Qwen-Plus?
* **Advanced Reasoning Capabilities:** Qwen-Plus excels at complex reasoning, structured planning, and technical decision-making, making it the perfect engine for a virtual project manager.
* **High-Performance Context Handling:** The model efficiently processes multi-dimensional context (project metadata, team structures, user roles, and chat history) to generate precise, grounded recommendations.
* **Developer-Friendly Integration:** DashScope's OpenAI-compatible API allowed us to seamlessly integrate Qwen-Plus into our existing backend architecture with minimal friction.

### Secure Server-Side Architecture
To ensure maximum security and performance, all communication with Alibaba Cloud is handled server-side:
1. The client sends a message and project ID to the Supabase Edge Function.
2. The Edge Function verifies the user's session and queries the PostgreSQL database to assemble the project context.
3. The Edge Function securely communicates with the DashScope API using the server-side `QWEN_API_KEY`.
4. The client receives the AI's response without ever exposing API keys, database secrets, or raw system prompts.

---



## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Set up your Supabase project.
2. Configure the `QWEN_API_KEY` in your Supabase Edge Function secrets.
3. Use the integrated SQL tools to set up the `profiles`, `projects`, `join_requests`, `messages`, and `notifications` schema.
